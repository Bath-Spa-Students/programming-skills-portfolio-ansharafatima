#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
#* Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store 
#their meanings as values.
#* Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print 
#the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between 
#each word-meaning pair in your output.
# Create a glossary dictionary with programming terms and their meanings.
glossary = {
    'Variable': 'A storage location for data in a program, which can be used to store and manipulate information.',
    'Function': 'A reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called.',
    'Conditional Statement': 'A control structure that allows a program to make decisions based on certain conditions.',
    'Loop': 'A control structure that allows a program to execute a block of code repeatedly.',
    'List': 'A collection of items that can be of different data types, stored in a specific order and accessed by index.'
}

# Print each programming term and its meaning with a newline between each pair.
for term, meaning in glossary.items():
    print(f"{term}:\n{meaning}\n")
