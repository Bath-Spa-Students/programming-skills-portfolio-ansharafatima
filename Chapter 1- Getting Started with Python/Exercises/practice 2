#Write a python program that takes courses marks as input and then calculates average of all the
#courses. After calculating the average, calculate the percentage of a student using total marks. Assume
#the total of all the courses marks is 500 or take the total marks from the user as input. 
# Get the number of courses from the user
num_courses = int(input("Enter the number of courses: "))

# Initialize a variable to store the total marks
total_marks = 500  # Assuming the total marks for all courses is 500

# Initialize a variable to store the sum of course marks
sum_of_marks = 0

# Input marks for each course and calculate their sum
for i in range(num_courses):
    marks = float(input(f"Enter marks for course {i + 1}: "))
    sum_of_marks += marks

# Calculate average of course marks
average_marks = sum_of_marks / num_courses

# Calculate percentage using total marks
percentage = (sum_of_marks / total_marks) * 100

# Displaying the average marks and percentage
print(f"Average marks: {average_marks}")
print(f"Percentage: {percentage}%")
